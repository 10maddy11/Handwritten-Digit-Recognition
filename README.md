# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

Hello friends this is simple sk-learn classifier which predicts which digit is given as input.

Implement this at a simple level to get started with Machine Learning

cool let's get started 

## Dependancies 
Here is a list to be installed in your python version. make shure you are using appropriate version so that it will suppeort well. I am using Python 3.6.2

  * pandas
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * scikit-learn 
 
This are enough to get started with this module.

## RUN

  1. First thing you need to create a folder to hold datasets in it called 'datasets' and u can download the necessary datasets form kagale. Link for the datasets is https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer put train.csv file in datasets.
  
  2. Next just run the given main.py file to genrate the result. code contain graph which indicate which input is selected by user.
  
  3. For differeent input just change the x_test[] list index in both step i. e. At input 'd' and 'predict' method.
  
  4. This can take few seconds to genrate the output.
